\begin{center}\textbf{Synopsis}\\ \end{center}

This is a report on the development of a software solution, which will aid Vestre Baadelaug with their administrative tasks.

The report contains a problem analysis, which is primarily based on interviews with representatives from Vestre Baadelaug. This creates the foundation for the following problem statement:\\

\enquote{How can one build a model of a boat clubs administrative responsibilities, concerning boats, boat spaces, members and guests, as well as implement a software solution which uses those models to convey information between the Harbour master, members and guests, with the purpose of improving the overview of the harbour.}

As an answer to this problem statement, a solution was created. Relevant theory is described, and the implementation of this theory will be explained. The testing of the solution will thereafter be described.
In conclusion to the report, the considerations and decisions will be discussed, after which the report will be concluded upon. Finally the solution will be put into perspective.
